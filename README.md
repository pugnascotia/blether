This is a toy project that aims to transpile Smalltalk to JavaScript, with an
emphasis on generating somewhat-human-readable code. It differs from, say,
[Amber](http://amber-lang.net/) in that it does not try implement a runtime in
JavaScript, but rather to re-use the existing JavaScript environment as fall as
possible.

It also represents an early foray into command-line Node applications, and could
probably benefit from a ground-up rewrite.

The parsing code was pinched and butchered from Amber.
